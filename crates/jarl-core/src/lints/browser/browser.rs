/// ## What it does
///
/// Checks for lingering presence of `browser()` which should not be present in
/// released code. Does not remove the call as it does not have a suitable
/// replacement. One option would be `NULL` but this is possibly also bad.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
///
/// `browser()` interrupts the execution of an expression and allows the inspection
/// of the environment where `browser()` was called from. This is helpful while
/// developing a function, but is not expected to be called by the user.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```r
/// do_something <- function(abc = 1) {
///    xyz <- abc + 1
///    browser()
///    xyz
/// }
///
/// ```
///
/// ## References
///
/// See `?browser`
