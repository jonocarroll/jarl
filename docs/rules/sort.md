# sort
## What it does

Checks for usage of `x[order(x, ...)]`.

## Why is this bad?

It is better to use `sort(x, ...)`, which is more readable than
`x[order(x, ...)]` and more efficient.

## Example

```r
x <- c(3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6)
x[order(x)]
x[order(x, na.last = TRUE)]
x[order(x, decreasing = TRUE)]
```

Use instead:
```r
x <- c(3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6)
sort(x)
sort(x, na.last = TRUE)
sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)
```
