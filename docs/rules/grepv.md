# grepv
## What it does

Checks for usage of `grep(..., value = TRUE)` and recommends using
`grepv()` instead (only if the R version used in the project is >= 4.5).

## Why is this bad?

Starting from R 4.5, there is a function `grepv()` that is identical to
`grep()` except that it uses `value = TRUE` by default.

Using `grepv(...)` is therefore more readable than `grep(...)`.

## Example

```r
x <- c("hello", "hi", "howdie")
grep("i", x, value = TRUE)
```

Use instead:
```r
x <- c("hello", "hi", "howdie")
grepv("i", x)
```
